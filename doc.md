 MRCS-SIGNAL-COMMON-DISTRIBUTION

 As "We Honest" signals become more popular, many users prefer to use a single limiting resistor per head, rather than a resistor per signal line (R/Y/G). This board provides 3 8-segment SIPs to 
 power up to 24 common leads (usually anode, but no reason it won't work for cathodes). The board features a barrel jack and a 4 position screw terminal for power input (ground is just passed through).
 Two 12 position 0.100 screw terminals provide connections to the signal heads.
